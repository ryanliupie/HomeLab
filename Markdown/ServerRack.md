# Server Rack 
 ![Rack2](/IMAGES/RACK2.jpg)

<p> For neatness and ease of access, I chose a 12U rack from "Power Cables" that fits 19-inch networking equipment. Each 1U is 1.75 inches tall, therefore the height of this rack is 1.75 x 12U = 21 inches or 53.34 cm tall. While it's not necessary for most homeowners to buy one, a rack offers a more organized setup, allowing easy access to equipment without having to scatter through a bunch of devices.</p>

  These types of racks, albeit usually much larger, are used in big organizations that need more space and power. Learning how to manage a rack can help you understand different types of hardware and how they work together.

 Remember a time when you had no internet at homeâ€”the first thing you might think is "router, router, router." A server rack helps organize all those pieces of equipment in one place, making it easier to troubleshoot and manage.
