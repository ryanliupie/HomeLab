# Switch 
![Switch](/IMAGES/Switch.jpg)

<p>  I went with a simple Tp-Link 16 Port Gigabit managed switch. Unfortunately, it does not come with SPF (Small-Form Pluggable)  or POE (Power Over Ethernet) ports but in my use case, it is not neccesary. </p> 
<br> 
<p> To explain a little further, a switch expands the number of available ethernet ports. The modem in your house allows for that internet connection from your ISP via a coaxial cable, DSL, or a fiber line. The issue with only having a modem is you are limited to only wired connectivity, no local network, no WI-FI and no network management. </p>
<br> 
<p> To solve this issue, you would purchase a router. Now a router operates at layer 3 of the OSI model; allowing devices to communicate with eachother simultanously, allows WI-FI , DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) , firewalls, and NAT (Network Address Translation).  </p>
