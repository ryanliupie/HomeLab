# Switch 
![Switch](/IMAGES/Switch.jpg)

<p>  I went with a simple Tp-Link 16 Port Gigabit managed switch. Unfortunately, it does not come with SPF (Small-Form Pluggable)  or POE (Power Over Ethernet) ports but in my use case, it is not neccesary. </p> 
<br> 
<p> To explain a little further, a switch expands the number of available ethernet ports. The modem in your house allows for that internet connection from your ISP (Internet Service Provider via a coaxial cable, DSL, or a fiber line. An example of an ISP could be Bell, Rogers or AT&T. The issue with only having a modem is you are limited to only wired connectivity, no local network, no WI-FI and no network management. </p>
<br> 
<p> To solve this issue, you would purchase a router. Now a router operates at layer 3 of the OSI model; allowing devices to communicate with eachother simultanously, allows WI-FI , DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) , firewalls, and NAT (Network Address Translation).  </p>

<p> Now, let's say you have devices that only support wired ethernet connections or simply WI-FI is too slow for you, what now? The switch comes into play where it has many RJ45 ports where you can connect it to. To do this, you would either patch the ethernet cables behind via a patch panel or simply plug them in the front.  </p>

<p> [Modem] plugs into --> [Router] plugs into --> [Switch] = Lot's of connections </p>
