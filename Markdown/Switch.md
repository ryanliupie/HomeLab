# Switch

<p> I opted for a simple TP-Link 16-port Gigabit managed switch. While it doesn't come with SFP (Small Form-factor Pluggable) or PoE (Power Over Ethernet) ports, these features aren’t necessary for my use case.

To explain further, a switch expands the number of available Ethernet ports. Your modem connects your home to the internet via your ISP (Internet Service Provider) through a coaxial cable, DSL, or fiber line. Examples of ISPs include Bell, Rogers, or AT&T. The issue with having only a modem is that you’re limited to wired connectivity—no local network, no Wi-Fi, and no network management.

To address this limitation, you would purchase a router. A router operates at Layer 3 of the OSI model, enabling devices to communicate with each other simultaneously. It also provides Wi-Fi, DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), firewalls, and NAT (Network Address Translation).
</p>

<p>
But what if you have devices that only support wired Ethernet connections, or if Wi-Fi is too slow for your needs? This is where the switch comes into play. The switch offers multiple RJ45 ports for connecting these devices. You can either patch the Ethernet cables through a patch panel or simply plug them directly into the front of the switch.
