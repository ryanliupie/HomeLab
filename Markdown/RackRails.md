# Server Rails 

![Rails](/IMAGES/Rails.JPG)

<p>In order to rack mount a server case, you need some support. Although you can use the front screws, it will be unstable fron the back because of the length and weight of the case. Previously, I added a shelf, where you can also place the server right on top. However, since I am going to be using up that space, it won't work. </p>

<p>  The best thing you can buy are server rails. Both of these rails screw in from the front and to the back; think of it like a bridge. By having that fully stability, allows myself to have a peace of mind that it will not fall and also the server to function at its upmost cability. </p>
