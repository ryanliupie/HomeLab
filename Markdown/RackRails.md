# Server Rails 

![Rails](/IMAGES/Rails2.JPG)

<p>To securely rack-mount a server case, you need proper support. While the front screws can hold the server in place, the back of the case may remain unstable due to its length and weight. Previously, I used a shelf to support the server, which worked well as a stable base. However, since I'll be using that space for other purposes, this solution is no longer viable, and the server may fall without adequate support.

<p> The best option is to use server rails. These rails screw into both the front and back of the rack, acting like a bridge. This full stability prevents the server from wobbling and makes it easier to access when needed, such as when adding a hard disk drive or performing routine cleaning.
