The case I went with is from "RackChoice" and it is a 2U Micro ATX that consists of 2 USB 2.0 ports and 2 USB 3.0 ports. â€ŽIt is 48.3 x 40 x 8.9 Centimetres (L x W x H), which is much shorter that most server rack cases. 

I initially was looking for 3U to 4U server cases as it is would be easier in application, however, inflation as it is, that would not be possible. The only limitation with this case would be the overall heating and the hardware space 

Think of it as a regular desktop case but instead of it being on the floor or on a desk, it is rackmountable in a server rack. In other applications, you can use an old desktop case and lie it flat on top of the shelf as well.
