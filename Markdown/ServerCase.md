# Server Case

I recently opted for a 2U Micro ATX case from "RackChoice" for my server build. This case features 2 USB 2.0 ports and 2 USB 3.0 ports, and its dimensions are 48.3 x 40 x 8.9 centimeters (L x W x H), making it much more compact than most standard server rack cases. To save money, I’ve decided to convert my existing PC into a server by transferring its components into this smaller case, allowing it to fit neatly into my server rack.

To clarify, a PC can essentially function as a server—the main difference is that a server typically runs 24/7, unlike a regular PC, which is often powered off when not in use. Of course, there are additional hardware and software considerations, but this is a simplified way to think about it.

The case on the left in the image is actually from one of my family member’s first-ever PCs, built around 29 years ago, and it will now become my first home server. To fit it into the rack, I plan to place the case on its side on the server rails. While this setup isn’t typical or ideal, it works for my specific needs. However, this approach does come with some potential issues, such as airflow constraints and stability concerns.
