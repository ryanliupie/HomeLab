The case I went with is from "RackChoice" and it is a 2U Micro ATX that consists of 2 USB 2.0 ports and 2 USB 3.0 ports. â€ŽIt is 48.3 x 40 x 8.9 Centimetres (L x W x H), which is much shorter that most server rack cases. 

I initially was looking for 3U to 4U server cases as it is would be easier in application, however, inflation as it is, that would not be possible. The limitation with this case, would be the overall heating and the limited space of hardware.
