# Server Case

<hr> 

The case I went with is from "RackChoice" and it is a 2U Micro ATX that consists of 2 USB 2.0 ports and 2 USB 3.0 ports. ‎It is 48.3 x 40 x 8.9 Centimetres (L x W x H), which is much shorter that most server rack cases. However, to save on my money, I will be using my PC into a server and swapping those components into a smaller case to fit the rack itself.  

The case on the left is actually one of my family members first ever PC around 29 years ago and it will be my first home server. To apply it in the rack, I will be placing it on its side on the server rails. This is not a typical/ideal setup, but it works in my case. However, there is a major problem when doing this seen below   → ↓
