# Patch Panel

A key aspect to be mindful of is cable management; no one wants a tangled mess of cables that are difficult to identify. To tackle this issue, investing in a patch panel can greatly reduce the stress caused by disorganized cables. In my setup, the patch panel will help keep CAT6 Ethernet cables neatly arranged. I considered two approaches: purchasing pre-made Ethernet cables or making my own. Ultimately, I decided to make my own, and below are the components you’ll need.

Although buying short Ethernet cables would have been cheaper, I chose to take the time to learn how to make them myself—and I encourage you to do the same! The cables are approximately 5 inches long and will connect to the switch below, providing connectivity to all devices.

The small blocks behind the patch panel are called "keystone jacks." They allow you to punch down Ethernet cables, enabling the passthrough connectors at the front to make the connection. The wire I'm holding is the long Ethernet cable coming from somewhere around the house. This could be connected to anything that uses an Ethernet cable, such as a fridge, computer, washing machine, or any other device.

Imagine plugging those cables into the front—it would create a messy situation. If we did that, those short Ethernet cables would essentially be a waste of time, as they’re meant to act as extensions. However, by plugging them in from the back, we can not only keep things more organized but also maintain easier access to other hardware components.
