# Patch Panel

A key aspect to be mindful of is cable management; no one wants a tangled mess of cables that are difficult to identify. To tackle this issue, investing in a patch panel can greatly reduce the stress caused by disorganized cables. In my setup, the patch panel will help keep CAT6 Ethernet cables neatly arranged. I considered two approaches: purchasing pre-made Ethernet cables or making my own. Ultimately, I decided to make my own, and below are the components you’ll need.

Athough it would have been cheaper to buy short ethernet cables, I would rather take the time to learn how to make them and you guys should too! The cables are approximately 5 inches long where these would connect to switch below; allowing connectively to all devices.

Those little blocks behind the patch panel are "keystone jacks". They allow you to punch down ethernet cables where the passthrough connectors at the front can make that connection. The wire I am holding would be the LONG ethernet cable coming from somewhere around the house. It could be a fridge, computer, washing machine or anything that uses an ethernet cable.

Imagine plugging those cables in the front, it would very messy. If we did that, those small ethernet cables would be a waste of time because they serve as an extention in way. Now if we plug from behind, we can not only make it more organized, but allows ease of access to other hardware components as well.
