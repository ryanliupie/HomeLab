    <div class="Heading"> What is a Homelab? </div>
      <p class="content"> A homelab is an environment where you learn and test 
        different pieces of computational software and hardware. I want you to picture some 
        components that have to deal with your internet and a couple of different 
        technologies that you have not tried. A homelab essentially serves as that controlled 
        environment where you combine both and build off from there.

  <div class="Heading"> Server Rack </div>
      <p class="content"> This piece of equipment organizes hardware as it easily 
        accessible to install, troubleshoot and change specific hardware. As you can 
        imagine, cables get messy and having a dedicated space to manage them, makes it 
        10x easier for you.

    <div class="Heading"> PDU(Power Distribution Unit)</div>
        <p class="content"> You need more electrical sockets? Buy a PDU. You need 
          to plug your phone/laptop charger, lamp, LED light, PC power cable? Buy a PDU. 
        The difference between the one shown below is that you can rackmount it instead of it
      lying on the floor.  </p>

    <div class="Heading"> Patch Panel </div>
        <p class="content"> Do you like messy cables? I'd assume not which is 
          why adding a patch panel organizes them such as ethernet cables.

          <p class="content"> If you need more ethernet ports to connect
            to different devices, a switch will do the job. The one I have is from 
            Yuanley which has 4 2.5 gb ethernet ports and 2 SFP+ ports

          compares to havin a regular shelf in a kitchen.
          You can store what you want on it in regards to 
          simple storage or non rackmountable hardware.

      <div class="Heading"> Server Rails </div>
        <p class="content"> In order to hold our 
          server in place, we need racks to place it 
          on top. If were were to simply screw it in, 
          it would work, however, there would be
          too much pressure on the screws as the server is 
          long in length causing an uneven weight distribution
