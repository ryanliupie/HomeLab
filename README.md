<h1>Ryan's Homelab</h1>
<p> In my opinion, a homelab is simply where you can learn and test new skills. More specifically, how you can utilize computing equipment to achieve various types of goals and tasks. This lab is meant to run as a media server, with the addition of programming, and conducting different cybersecurity tasks such as penetration testing, and cryptography. Not only that but it will be used to learn how to troubleshoot different types of hardwares and softwares.   </p>

<h2> Server Rack </h2>

<p> For neatness and ease of access, I went with a 12U rack from "Powercables", that fits 19 inch networking equipment. 
  It's not neccesary to buy one for most common homeowners, however, it is much more organized as you can access what you need 
  withouth scattering through a bunch of equipment. These types of racks, rather much larger one's, are used in larger organizations that
  need more space/power. Learning how to manage this, will help with understanding different types of hardware and how they work together.</p>
