<h2> Welcome </h2>
<p> A homelab is a personal environment where you can learn and test new skills. More specifically, it‚Äôs a space to explore how computing equipment can be utilized to achieve various goals and tasks. My homelab is designed to deploy Docker, Proxmox, Plex, PiKVM, Pi-hole, Kubernetes, and more! It will serve as a platform for learning how to troubleshoot different types of hardware and software with the addition of developing future projects!</p>
  
 <p> With the utilization of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I will be displaying the progression of my homelab, mistakes made, and the results. </p>

<p> Down below, you can click on each markdown to learn more about each of the components that I used or you can click here [pending website] as well. üïπÔ∏è   </p>
