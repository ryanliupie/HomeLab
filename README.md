<h1>Ryan's Homelab</h1>
<p> In my opinion, a homelab is simply where you can learn and test new skills. More specifically, how you can utilize computing equipment to achieve various types of goals and tasks. This lab is meant to run as a media server, with the addition of programming, and conducting different cybersecurity tasks such as penetration testing, and cryptography. Not only that but it will be used to learn how to troubleshoot different types of hardwares and softwares.   </p>

<h2> Server Rack </h2>

<p> For neatness and ease of access, I went with a 12U rack from "Power cables", that fits 19-inch networking equipment. Each 1U is 1.75 inches tall, 
  therefore the height of this rack is 1.75 x 12U = 21 inches or 53.34cm tall. 
  It's not necessary to buy one for most common homeowners, however, it is much more organized as you can access what you need 
  without scattering through a bunch of equipment. These types of racks, rather much larger ones, are used in big organizations that
  need more space/power. Learning how to manage this, will help with understanding different types of hardware and how they work together.</p>

<h2> PDU (Power Distribution Unit) </h2>

<p> A PDU unit is when you need more sockets to plug into. I got a 125V 15A (12A UL) 8 outlet PDU from StarTech. Now what do those numbers even mean? 
  Well 125V means that the PDU is able to supply 125 voltage of alternating current (AC). This is the North American standard for households or simple 
  office buildings. 15A(amperes) refers to the measure of the maximum amount of eletrical current that it can handle safely. Now the 12A UL is a recommendation 
  that even though the PDU can handle up to 15A, it is best to use it up to 12A for safety by Underwriters Laboratory (UL).

Look at how you charge your phone or plug a computer into the wall. The piece of equipment that is already attached to the wall connected to the AC electrical circuit is a socket/receptacle/outlet. Now
if you buy a technical device, it will most likely need to be plugged into the wall to perform a function. Now let's say, you got your phone, 
speaker, lamp, ALEXA and, a laptop. You need to plug all these devices, but there are only 2 sockets, how do you troubleshoot? You would buy a 
PDU unit, where it has a plug that plugs into the outlet where it distributes the power throughout the sockets on the PDU. This allows you to have 
more devices plugged in; creating an electrical circuit for more devices to perform.

<h2> Patch Panel </h2>
<p> Would you rather have a mess of wires or have tidy wiring? I'd assume you'd want to keep everything tidy and to do this, you would need a patch panel. 
This type of hardware is simply used for cable management, and in this use case, it would be used to keep CAT6 ethernet cables organized. </p>
