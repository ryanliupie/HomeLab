<h1> My Homelab</h1>
<hr> 
<h2> Welcome </h2>
<p> A homelab is a personal environment where you can learn and test new skills. More specifically, it‚Äôs a space to explore how computing equipment can be utilized to achieve various goals and tasks. My homelab is designed to function as a media server and to support programming, penetration testing, and cryptography activities. 
<br>
  
It will serve as a platform for learning how to troubleshoot different types of hardware and software. Additionally, with the utilization of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I will be displaying the progression of my homelab, including mistakes, troubleshooting, and results.
