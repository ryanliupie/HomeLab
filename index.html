        <div class="heading">Homelab?</div>
        <p class="content"> 
          A homelab is an environment where you learn and test different pieces of computational software and hardware. 
          I want you to picture some components that have to deal with your internet and a couple of different technologies that you have not tried. 
          A homelab essentially serves as that controlled environment where you combine both and build off from there.

    <div class="heading">Server Rack</div>
    <p class="content"> 
        This piece of equipment organizes hardware as it easily accessible to install, troubleshoot and change specific hardware. As you can 
        imagine, cables get messy and having a dedicated space to manage them, makes it 10x easier for you.

    <p class="content"> 
        You need more electrical sockets? Buy a PDU. You need to plug your phone/laptop charger, lamp, LED light, PC power cable? Buy a PDU. 
        The difference between the one shown below is that you can rackmount it instead of it lying on the floor.

    <p class="content"> 
        Do you like messy cables? I'd assume not which is why adding a patch panel organizes them such as ethernet cables.

    <div class="heading">Switch</div>
    <p class="content"> 
        If you need more ethernet ports to connect to different devices, a switch will do the job. The one I have is from 
        TP-Link which is a managed switch with 8 gigabit ethernet ports

    <div class="heading">Shelf</div>
    <p class="content"> 
          Now having a shelf in a rack compares to havin a regular shelf in a kitchen. You can store what you want on it in regards to 
          simple storage or non rackmountable hardware.

     <div class="heading">Server Rails</div>
     <p class="content"> 
          In order to hold our server in place, we need racks to place it on top. If were were to simply screw it in, it would work, 
          however, there would be too much pressure on the screws as the server is ong in length causing an uneven weight distribution.
